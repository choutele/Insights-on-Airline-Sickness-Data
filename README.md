# Insights-on-Airport-Sickness-Data

Objective and Scope of Analysis
The primary goal of this analysis is to gain a deeper understanding of the provided data to uncover patterns, relationships, and critical insights that can inform operational decisions. The analysis is structured to cover multiple stages, starting from data cleaning and preprocessing, followed by exploratory data analysis (EDA), and culminating in predictive modeling to forecast sickness days. Each step serves a specific purpose and collectively contributes to identifying actionable insights that can improve operational efficiency, staffing strategies, and overall business performance.

Understanding the Data and Preprocessing:
The first step involves familiarizing ourselves with the data to ensure consistency, completeness, and accuracy. This includes handling missing values, standardizing formats, and addressing data quality issues. By ensuring a clean dataset, we lay a strong foundation for reliable analysis and accurate results.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
EDA allows us to explore data patterns, trends, and distributions. Visualizations help us grasp key metrics like sickness trends, queue times, and retail sales performance over time. Understanding these patterns is critical for identifying operational bottlenecks, peak periods, and potential correlations.

Relationship Analysis (Correlation):
Correlation analysis helps quantify relationships between variables such as sickness days, queue times, and retail sales. It highlights how certain factors may influence each other, such as the potential impact of staff sickness on queue times and sales. These relationships provide data-driven evidence for decision-making.

Critical Insights and Immediate Attention:
The analysis focuses on uncovering insights that demand immediate action. For instance, identifying periods of high sickness that coincide with increased queue times or drops in sales helps prioritize interventions like optimizing staffing or reviewing operational strategies during peak periods.

Recommended Actions and Future Scope:
Based on the insights, practical recommendations are provided to improve operations, enhance customer experience, and mitigate the negative effects of workforce shortages. This can involve targeted interventions during high-risk months, resource allocation, or seasonal planning. The future scope includes integrating new data sources like passenger footfall or weather data to enrich the analysis.

Predictive Model for Sickness Days Forecasting:
The final step involves building a predictive model to forecast sickness days. This model equips the organization with the capability to anticipate workforce shortages and plan resources accordingly. Accurate forecasting can significantly reduce operational risks, improve workforce management, and boost overall performance.

Impact of the Analysis
The insights and predictive model derived from this analysis can bring substantial value to decision-makers by enabling data-driven planning and strategic interventions. By understanding patterns and correlations, businesses can optimize resource allocation, reduce operational inefficiencies, and improve both customer experience and employee well-being. The predictive model adds a forward-looking component, allowing for proactive measures that enhance business continuity and resilience. Ultimately, this analysis transforms raw data into actionable intelligence, supporting continuous improvement and future growth.
